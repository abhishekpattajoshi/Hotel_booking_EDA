Nowadays lot of resort and city hotels are facing high cancellation rates. Due to which there revenue is getting decreased. Subsequently their revenue is getting decreased due to maintainance of rooms. To overcome this problem I have found a dataset on kaggle. I have done EDA on the dataset and found out the reasons for the cancellations of bookings. I have also given some business advice to overcome the issue of decreasing revenue.

## Problem Objective
In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.

## Research Questions
- What are the factors that are affecting reservation cancellation?
- How can we decrease the cancellations?
- How can we assist in making pricing and promotional decisions?

## Assumptions
- There is no outliers in the dataset that have impact on our problem.
- The data is from 2015-17 but we assume that data is still current and possible plans can be used in efficient manner.
- When the room get cancelled the room will remain vacant till the particular booking period and no earning will be generated from that room for that booking period.

## EDA Insights
- Around 37% of bookings are cancelled which is very high.
- The cancellation of reservation in city hotel is more compare to the cancellation resort hotel.This may be because the price of resort hotel is more compare to city hotel.
- 27.9% of booking is getting cancelled in case of resort booking and 41.7% of bookings are getting cancelled in case of city hotel.
- We saw that the price of the resort hotels are more compare to the city hotels. The spike in the price may be because of weekends where the booking in resort hotel gets increased.
- Cancellation of booking is highest in the month of january and lowest in the month of august. It may be because the price of booking is higher in the month of january and lowest in the month of august.
- Portugal is the country where majority of the bookings get cancelled. The hotels should think about giving offers and promotion so that the cancellation will get decrease in portugal. They should also think about reducing the prices and giving more facilties at same price.
- 46.9% of booking out of 47.4% of online booking is getting cancelled. This may be because while booking online platforms may have shown various facilities but in actual those facilities are not present.

## Suggestions
1. Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
2. As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.
3. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.
4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
