Nowadays lot of resort and city hotels are facing high cancellation rates. Due to which there revenue is getting decreased. Subsequently their revenue is getting decreased due to maintainance of rooms. To overcome this problem I have found a dataset on kaggle. I have done EDA on the dataset and found out the reasons for the cancellations of bookings. I have also given some business advice to overcome the issue of decreasing revenue.

# Problem Objective

Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem.
